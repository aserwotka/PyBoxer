# PyBoxer

Little GUI app for basic Dropbox account operations in Linux OS. Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04.

## Prerequisites

Be sure you have python3 installed.

You need to configure script. Instruction is available at the [Dropbox-Uploader](Dropbox-Uploader) page.

Or you can read [graphical version](http://raspi.tv/2013/how-to-use-dropbox-with-raspberry-pi) instead.

After configuration you need to indicate script path in dropbox_uploader_path.txt file. Example exists already in this file.

## Running

Go into project directory and simply type:

```
python3 MainWindow.py
```

## Contributing

The project uses [Dropbox-Uploader](https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader) script.
